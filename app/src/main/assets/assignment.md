This application will have two screens :

List of Movies

There are 3 categories of movies list that user could select 
(using tabs/navigation drawer) : Now Playing, Upcoming, and Popular.
Each movie item displayed in the list/grid must at least contain the movie poster, 
movie title, and rating score (based on votes). 
The application must load the next page of data when user scrolls to the end of the list. 
And if user clicks an item in the list, it will display the Movie Detail screen for 
the selected movie.
